        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; font-size: 1.1rem; color: #555;">
            <strong>Nepal Civic</strong> is designed to modernize how local problems are reported and resolved. 
            We believe that every citizen deserves a voice, and every Ward Officer needs the right tools to serve effectively.

            <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Direct digital reporting removes the need for physical applications and paperwork.</li>
